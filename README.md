# AltAmino Applications

## Why we have repo for this?

Github allows make releases of apps without any pain, so I choosed gh ofc.

Also maybe I will upload here source code, i dunno. I'm planning to open source code of servers, so maybe open source of app will be reasonable.

## Warning!

All Android releases will be like "Stable", all iOS - "Beta"!

Also Android releases support only armeabi-v7a for now!

For now here is no iOS builds bcause crapple forcing to use mac for their xcode and modifying original app. Until it unresolved, srry n8s, no iOS builds.

## Requirements

Apple devices: iOS 13.0+

Android: 6.0+, armeabi-v7a support (check this using Aida64 for Android).

This is TRUE reqs of app btw. But android one doesnt need google services :D
