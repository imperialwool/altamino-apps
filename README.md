# AltAmino Applications

The main server (will be) stopped on February 1, but you have the sources. You can build everything yourself.

Alas, the source code of the app is lost, so you can decompile the app yourself via JADX and apktool.

[Source code of server,](https://github.com/imperialwool/altamino)

## Why we have repo for this?

Github allows make releases of apps without any pain, so I choosed gh ofc.

Also maybe I will upload here source code, i dunno. I'm planning to open source code of servers, so maybe open source of app will be reasonable.

## Warning!

All Android releases will be like "Stable", all iOS - "Beta"!

Also Android releases support only armeabi-v7a for now!

## Requirements

Apple devices: iOS 14.0 - 16.6.1, 16.7 RC (20H18), 17.0; [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore).

This is TRUE reqs of app btw. But android one doesnt need google services :D
